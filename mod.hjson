'''

This is a very small mod that simply replaces some existing content in the game.

--- -- -- - - -

This mod includes:
-- Door: custom sprites, sound
-- Logic: custom sprites

--- -- -- - - -

It was created, at least, to slightly refresh the experience of constructing logic circuits from logic elements, in which a binary signal is transmitted through doors.
